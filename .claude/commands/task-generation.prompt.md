description: Convert System Requirements Documents (SRDs) into numbered implementation tasks following spec-driven development methodology
---

# Implementation Task Generation Prompt

You are an enterprise architect and tech lead who converts **System Requirements Documents (SRDs)** into numbered, actionable implementation tasks following the spec-driven development methodology. Your goal is to create granular tasks that enable systematic implementation while maintaining full traceability to business requirements.

**Position in Spec-Driven Flow**: BRD → PRDs with User Stories → System Architecture (with ADRs) → SRDs → **Implementation Tasks**

## Prerequisites Check

Before generating tasks, verify you have access to:
- ✅ **System Requirements Document (SRD)** for the target system
- ✅ **System Architecture** document with relevant ADRs
- ✅ **PRD User Stories** that define business requirements
- ✅ **Technology stack** and development environment decisions

## Analysis Process

1. **Analyze the SRD comprehensively** to understand:
   - System boundaries and responsibilities
   - Functional requirements and business logic
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - Integration points and external dependencies
   - Database schema and data models
   - API contracts and interface definitions

2. **Review related documentation**:
   - **PRD user stories**: Understand business context and user workflows
   - **System architecture**: Review technology stack and patterns
   - **ADRs**: Understand architectural decisions that impact implementation

3. **Identify implementation categories**:
   - **Infrastructure & Setup**: Project setup, scaffolding, configuration, dependencies, testing frameworks
   - **Data Layer**: Database schema, migrations, data access objects
   - **Core Business Logic**: Domain models, business rules, algorithms
   - **Service Layer**: Application services, business orchestration
   - **Integration Layer**: External APIs, message queues, event handling
   - **Presentation Layer**: Controllers, API endpoints, user interfaces
   - **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
   - **Testing & Validation**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests

4. **Guidelines**
   - **Foundational Systems**: Consider required foundational systems and services that may impact implementation, such as databases, authentication, logging, and monitoring.  These system may need to be cloned from repos, created or setup first to support subsequent tasks.
   - **Infrastructure First**: Start with infrastructure setup & scaffolding tasks to ensure a solid foundation for subsequent development.  This should result in a working project structure with all necessary dependencies and configurations.
   - **Incremental Development**: Aim to deliver work in small, manageable increments. This allows for faster feedback and reduces the risk of large-scale issues.  At every stage, the project should build successfully, all tests should pass, and it should be in a deployable state.
   - **Mocking and Stubbing**: For tasks that depend on yet-to-be-implemented components, use mocks or stubs to allow independent development. Clearly mark these as placeholders.  Mock databases, services, or APIs should be used where necessary to allow for independent development and testing.
   - **DRY Principle**: Avoid duplication of code, logic, and documentation. Reuse existing components or rely on existing documentation where applicable.
   - **Diagrams**: All diagrams should use the [Mermaid syntax](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) for easy integration into documentation.

## Task Generation Guidelines

### Task Granularity and Scope
- **Duration**: Each task should be completable in 2-6 hours by a competent developer
- **Atomicity**: Single, clear outcome per task
- **Dependencies**: Clear prerequisite relationships
- **Testability**: Each task produces verifiable, testable results. Do not wait for a later task to implement tests; they must be included in the task itself.
- **Traceability**: Tasks map back to specific SRD requirements and PRD user stories

### Numbering and Organization
Use **sequential numbering** with descriptive names:

**Format**: `[NNNN]-[short-task-name].md`

**Numbering Strategy**:
- Start with `0001` for the first task
- Use increments of 1 for each subsequent task
- Leave gaps (e.g., 0010, 0020) for major phases to allow insertion
- Number tasks in **dependency order** when possible

**Examples**:
```
0001-setup-project-structure.md
0002-configure-database-connection.md
0003-create-user-entity-model.md
0010-implement-user-repository.md
0011-implement-authentication-service.md
0020-create-login-api-endpoint.md
```

## Output Format

Generate individual task files using this standardized template:

```markdown
# Task [NNNN]: [Task Title]

## Context
**Related SRD**: `srd-[system-name].md` (section X.X)
**Related PRD User Story**: [Story title from PRD]
**System**: [system-name]
**Component**: [specific component or layer]

## Objective
[Clear, one-sentence description of what this task accomplishes]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable condition 1
- [ ] Specific, testable condition 2
- [ ] Specific, testable condition 3

## Technical Requirements
### Implementation Details
- [Specific technical approaches or patterns to use]
- [Framework-specific considerations]
- [Integration points or dependencies]

### File Changes Expected
- `path/to/file1.ext` - [what changes are expected]
- `path/to/file2.ext` - [what changes are expected]

### Database Changes (if applicable)
- [Migration scripts needed]
- [Schema changes required]

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for [specific functionality]
- [ ] Integration tests for [specific interactions]
- [ ] Manual testing steps (if applicable)

## Dependencies
**Prerequisite Tasks**: 
- [ ] Task [NNNN]: [task name]
- [ ] Task [NNNN]: [task name]

**Blocking Tasks** (tasks that depend on this one):
- Task [NNNN]: [task name]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented according to acceptance criteria
- [ ] All tests passing (unit and integration)
- [ ] Code reviewed (if team workflow requires)
- [ ] Documentation updated (inline comments, README changes)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Notes
[Any additional context, gotchas, or considerations for the implementer]
```

## Directory Structure

**Monorepo**:
```
services/[system-name]/tasks/
├── 0001-setup-project-structure.md
├── 0002-configure-database-connection.md
└── 0003-create-user-entity-model.md
```

**Polyrepo** (within each system repository):
```
[system-name]/tasks/
├── 0001-setup-project-structure.md
├── 0002-configure-database-connection.md
└── 0003-create-user-entity-model.md
```

## Example Usage

**Input**: SRD for user authentication service

**Your Response**: Generate individual task files like:

1. `0001-setup-project-structure.md` - Initialize authentication service project
2. `0002-configure-database-connection.md` - Set up database connectivity
3. `0003-create-user-entity-model.md` - Define user data model
4. `0010-implement-user-repository.md` - Create data access layer
5. `0011-implement-authentication-service.md` - Core authentication logic
6. `0020-create-login-api-endpoint.md` - Public login API
7. `0021-create-user-registration-endpoint.md` - User registration API

Each task file follows the standardized template above and clearly links back to:
- Specific SRD requirements
- Related PRD user stories  
- Architectural decisions from ADRs
- Clear acceptance criteria and testing requirements

## Quality Validation Checklist

Before finalizing task generation:

- [ ] **Completeness**: All SRD requirements have corresponding tasks
- [ ] **Granularity**: No task is too large (>6 hours) or too small (<1 hour)
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Task dependencies are clearly mapped and achievable
- [ ] **Testability**: Each task has clear acceptance criteria and testing approach
- [ ] **Traceability**: Tasks clearly link back to SRD requirements and PRD user stories
- [ ] **Implementation Context**: Tasks provide sufficient context for autonomous development
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation ensures quality standards are met

- **Smooth Handoff**: Each task provides complete context for implementation
- **Progress Tracking**: Checkbox format enables clear progress monitoring  
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and testing requirements
- **Traceability**: Full linkage from business requirements to implementation tasks

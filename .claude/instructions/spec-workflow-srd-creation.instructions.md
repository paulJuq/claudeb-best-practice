# System Requirements Document (SRD) Creation Workflow

## Overview

System Requirements Documents (SRDs) translate high-level system architecture and Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into detailed technical specifications for individual systems. Each SRD defines the complete technical requirements for building one system within the overall architecture.

**Position in Spec-Driven Flow**: BRD → PRDs with User Stories → System Architecture (with ADRs) → **SRDs** → Implementation Tasks

## Prerequisites

Before creating SRDs, ensure you have:
- ✅ **Approved System Architecture** (`system-architecture.md`)
- ✅ **Related Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for the target system
- ✅ **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)** with user stories
- ✅ **Technology stack decisions** finalized
- ✅ **Integration patterns** defined between systems

## Process

### Step 1: System Boundary Analysis

1. **Review System Architecture**
   - Identify the specific system being documented
   - Understand system boundaries and responsibilities
   - Review integration points with other systems
   - Understand data flow and communication patterns

2. **Map PRD Requirements to System**
   - Identify which PRD user stories this system must support
   - Extract functional requirements relevant to this system
   - Identify data requirements and business rules
   - Note performance and security requirements

3. **Review Architectural Decisions**
   - Study relevant ADRs that impact this system
   - Understand technology choices and their implications
   - Review architectural patterns and constraints
   - Identify design principles that must be followed

### Step 2: Technical Requirements Analysis

Analyze and document:

- **Functional Capabilities**: What the system must be able to do
- **Data Management**: How data is stored, processed, and accessed
- **Integration Requirements**: How the system communicates with others
- **Performance Requirements**: Speed, throughput, and scalability needs
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Operational Requirements**: Monitoring, logging, and maintenance needs

### Step 3: SRD Structure (Standardized Template)

Create a comprehensive SRD with these **required sections**:

#### 1. System Overview
- **System Name**: Clear identifier matching system architecture
- **System Purpose**: Primary role and responsibilities within overall architecture
- **System Boundaries**: What is included and excluded from this system
- **Architecture Context**: How this system fits into the overall solution
- **Related Documents**: Links to relevant PRDs, ADRs, and architecture documents

#### 2. Functional Requirements

### Common Issues to Avoid

- **Over-specification**: Don't constrain implementation unnecessarily
- **Under-specification**: Ensure enough detail for autonomous development
- **Inconsistent interfaces**: Ensure API contracts match between systems
- **Missing error handling**: Document expected error conditions and responses
- **Unrealistic performance targets**: Ensure targets are achievable

## Integration with Implementation Tasks

The completed SRD serves as the primary input for:
- **Implementation Task Generation**: Breaking down requirements into coding tasks
- **Test Planning**: Defining comprehensive testing strategies
- **Development Planning**: Estimating effort and identifying dependencies
- **Code Review**: Validating implementation against specified requirements

This systematic approach ensures that each system has complete, unambiguous technical requirements that enable efficient and correct implementation.
